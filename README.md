* [Latest Version](https://github.com/ualegre/rcase/tree/master/rcase/target)

======
[Modelio](https://www.modelio.org/) is an open-source modelling project. The project in this repository contains the code and binaries of a Modelio module 
which has been created in order to aid developers of context-aware systems during the requirements elicitation development stage. It is complementary to another Modelio module for supporting the design and code generation of context-aware systems [DC-ASE](https://github.com/ualegre/dcase). More information on the theoretical aspects of this module can be found in:
[Engineering context-aware systems and applications: A survey](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2016.02.010)
[Perspectives on engineering more usable context-aware systems](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-018-0863-7)
